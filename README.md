# Ren'Py Event Editor

Ren'Py Event Editor forked from this: [Ren'Py Event Editor 2.1.1 forum post][1]

#Now it:
- Added some basic speakers
- Added bgs from Tango Palette  
- Automatic generate buttons for all images stored placed in *game/images*:
  - * now png and jpg are supported
  - *game/images/bgs* for backgrounds
  - *game/images/envents* for events
- Save your events to *game/events*
- All list are scrollable
- Genterate buttons for all spekers added to speakers list

To fix:
  - *game/image/characters* for charaters sprites - don't work :(
